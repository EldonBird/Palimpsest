# Overview

This project is a C# based encryption exploration. The goal of this project was to try to understand basic cryptography and create a program that could be used to encrypt and decrypt files. Part of my project was creating an actual functional UI, which is mostly left undone for most of my projects.

# Development Environment

This project was again coded in C# in Rider, I mainly chose these as my project because I am comfortable with C# and Rider is my preferred IDE. The project is a "Windows Form Manager", which is a Program/UI design tool that lets you put together a functional UI quickly.
